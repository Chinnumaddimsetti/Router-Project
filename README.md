Routing is the process of transporting a packet of data from a source to a destination, allowing messages to flow
from one computer to another until they reach their goal. A router is a networking device that sends data
packets from one computer network to another. In contrast to a network switch, which joins data lines from a
single network, it is connected to two or more data lines from distinct networks. This paper focuses on the
router device, its top-level architecture, and how several sub-modules of the router, such as Register, FIFO,
FSM, and Synchronizer, are synthesised, simulated, and finally coupled to the top module. A million transistors
can be integrated on a single chip with System on Chip
